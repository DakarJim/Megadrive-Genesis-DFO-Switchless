I recommand to put the multibios in this order:

Original --> EU --> JAP --> USA

( Original is when the PIN are lifted or grounded.)


For my Japanese MegaCD here's the command I put in the batch file:


copy /B jp.bin + eu.bin + jp.bin + us.bin JEJU.bin

Then program the output BIN file in a 27C4096


If the order is not working, try to invert the wire on the Eprom.
